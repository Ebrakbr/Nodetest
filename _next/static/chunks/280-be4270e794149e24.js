It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm."),(0,o.kt)(i,{mdxType:"ResourceGroupTitle"},"Free Content"),(0,o.kt)(s,{colorScheme:"blue",badgeText:"Read",href:"https://nodejs.org/en/about/",mdxType:"BadgeLink"},"Official Website"),(0,o.kt)(s,{colorScheme:"yellow",badgeText:"Read",href:"https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp",mdxType:"BadgeLink"},"Node.JS Introduction"),(0,o.kt)(s,{colorScheme:"green",badgeText:"Read",href:"https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/",mdxType:"BadgeLink"},"Official Website"),(0,o.kt)(s,{badgeText:"Watch",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ",mdxType:"BadgeLink"},"What is Node.js?"),(0,o.kt)(s,{badgeText:"Watch",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOupHNvDIq8",mdxType:"BadgeLink"},"How Node.js Works?"))}l.isMDXComponent=!0},41760:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{default:function(){return i}});n(67294);var o=n(3905);function r(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r={},a=Object.keys(e);for(o=0;o<a.length;o++)n=a[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(r[n]=e[n]);return r}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(o=0;o<a.length;o++)n=a[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(r[n]=e[n])}return r}var a={};function i(e){var t=e.components,n=r(e,["components"]);return(0,o.kt)("wrapper",Object.assign({},a,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,o.kt)("h1",null,"Why nodejs"))}i.isMDXComponent=!0},58450:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{default:function(){return l}});n(67294);var o=n(3905);function r(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r={},a=Object.keys(e);for(o=0;o<a.length;o++)n=a[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(r[n]=e[n]);return r}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(o=0;o<a.length;o++)n=a[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(r[n]=e[n])}return r}var a=function(e){return function(t){return console.warn("Component "+e+" was not imported, exported, or provided by MDXProvider as global scope"),(0,o.kt)("div",Object.assign({},t))}},i=a("ResourceGroupTitle"),s=a("BadgeLink"),c={};function l(e){var t=e.components,n=r(e,["components"]);return(0,o.kt)("wrapper",Object.assign({},c,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,o.kt)("h1",null,"History of Node.js"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.
